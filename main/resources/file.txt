Before you create objects in Java, you need to define a class. A class is a blueprint for the object.
We can think of the class as a sketch of a house. It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows, etc. Based on these descriptions we build the house. House is the object.
Since many houses can be made from the same description, we can create many objects from a class?
